Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at Holberton School. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language.

All work contained in this project was completed as part of the curriculum for Holberton School. Holberton School is a campus-based full-stack software engineering program that prepares students for careers in the tech industry using project-based peer learning. For more information, visit
